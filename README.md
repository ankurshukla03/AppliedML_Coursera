## Repository for Applied Machine Learning in Python
- This repository contains the code for all the programming tasks to the University of Michigan's "Applied Machine Learning in Python" course.
- You can check the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/home/welcome)
- I encourage not to copy the code but you can have a look if you are in doubt. Solving on your own will give a sense of confidence for designing these models later on.
